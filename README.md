# snake game
## Description
A simple classic snake game built using C++ programming language

## Game Overview

The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat the food and grow longer. As the snake grows longer, it becomes harder to control without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game is over when the snake collides with either the walls or its own body.
